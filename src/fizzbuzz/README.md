### TITLE: [FizzBuzz Solution](http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/) 

### REQUIREMENTS:
1. use 10 mins deconstruct the problem and make the todo list before starting
2. count time spent
3. TDD - test first then code
4. distinguish time spent on phase1 and phase2  

### DETAILS:
#### [0.1.0] - 2019-04-27
* timeSpent:
* > 20 + 7 + 3 + 20 + 4 + 30 = 84mins... Certainly, I am novice!!!
* quality: 7/10
* > has some extensibility I think. But also need refactoring.
* how about TDD
* > It's a kind of safety guarantee mentally I think.
* differences of sequence between todo list and real work
* > When I start coding, I found that I did't think thoroughly enough.
* notes:
* > I just wake up... So I spent 20 mins create test cases... \
I still did't know whether should I put the for iteration in function or put it outside the core function.
* > I made a mistake on object linked to other objects program modal. I store the variable in the prototype which is polluted.
