### TITLE: [Args](http://codingdojo.org/kata/Args/)

### REQUIREMENTS:
1. use 10 mins deconstruct the problem and make the todo list before starting
2. count time spent
3. TDD - test first then code

### DETAILS:
#### [0.1.0] - 2019-05-02
* timeSpent:
* > 20mins(deconstruct the problem) + 90mins(implement idea using code with TDD) = 110mins
* quality: 7/10
* > It's ok, and it can be better.
* how about TDD
* > It's great. I will be happy and encouraged if there is PASS on my screen.
* differences of sequence between todo list and real case
* > `todo list` is just a rodemap. But `real case` means more specific problems that I never thought about before.
* notes:
* > To be honest, I tried two days ago. Then I found that I made a mistake while deconstructing the problem, which made me hard to pass the unittest. Then I tried another method and it worked.
